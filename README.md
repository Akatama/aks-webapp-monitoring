# aks-webapp-monitoring
Deploying a Web Application with cluster monitoring utilizing Azure Kubernetes Service.

Taking some tips from here for the Web App (but while this project uses EKS, I will use AKS):

You can also read this step-by-step-guide here:

I will note that while later projects in that same repo add Terraform and Monitoring, for my implementations of those I will be going on my own.
